## shopping-cat-app

This is a small shopping cart app with home page (products list) and shopping cart page.
You can add and remove items to and from the cart.

Deployed version [https://shopping-cart-app-td.netlify.app/](https://shopping-cart-app-td.netlify.app/)

_Since product json schema states only one quantity value for different product options, it was impossible to handle stock availability when adding to the cart. Instead I decided that the added products with different options are considered different items._
